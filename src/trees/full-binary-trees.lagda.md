## Idea

A {{#concept "plane tree" Agda=full-binary-tree}} is a finite tree that can be
drawn on a plane with the root at the bottom, and all branches directed upwards.
More preciesly, a plane tree consists of a root and a family of plane trees
indexed by a
[standard finite type](univalent-combinatorics.standard-finite-types.md).

## Definitions

### Plane trees

```agda
data full-binary-tree : UU lzero where
  leaf-full-binary-tree : full-binary-tree
  join-full-binary-tree : (s t : full-binary-tree) â†’ full-binary-tree
```
