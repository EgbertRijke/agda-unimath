## Idea

A [pointed type](structured-types.pointed-types.md) is said to be {{#concept "small" Disambiguation="pointed type" Agda=is-small-Pointed-Type}} is its underlying type is [small](foundation.small-types.md). Equivalently, we say that a type is {{#concept "pointedly small" Agda=is-pointedly-small-Pointed-Type}} if it comes equipped with an element of type

```text
  Œ£ (Y : Pointed-Type l), X ‚âÉ‚àó Y
```

The difference between small pointed types and pointedly small pointed types is that the notion of small pointed type is unpointed, and therefore potentially easier to establish. It is immediate that a pointedly small type is small. For the converse, note that if `X` is small, and `Y : ùí∞` comes equipped with an [equivalence](foundation-core.equivalences.md) `e : type-Pointed-Type X ‚âÉ Y`, then we take `e * : Y` to be the base point, and it is immediate that `e` is a [pointed equivalence](structured-types.pointed-equivalences.md).

## Definitions

### Small pointed types

```agda
module _
  {l1 : Level} (l2 : Level) (X : Pointed-Type l1)
  where

  is-small-prop-Pointed-Type : Prop (l1 ‚äî lsuc l2)
  is-small-prop-Pointed-Type = is-small-Prop l2 (type-Pointed-Type X)

  is-small-Pointed-Type : UU (l1 ‚äî lsuc l2)
  is-small-Pointed-Type = is-small l2 (type-Pointed-Type X)

  is-prop-is-small-Pointed-Type : is-prop is-small-Pointed-Type
  is-prop-is-small-Pointed-Type = is-prop-is-small l2 (type-Pointed-Type X)
```

### Pointedly small types

```agda
module _
  {l1 : Level} (l2 : Level) (X : Pointed-Type l1)
  where

  is-pointedly-small-Pointed-Type : UU (l1 ‚äî lsuc l2)
  is-pointedly-small-Pointed-Type =
    Œ£ (Pointed-Type l2) (Œª Y ‚Üí X ‚âÉ‚àó Y)
```

## Properties

### Being pointedly small is a property

```agda
module _
  {l1 l2 : Level} (X : Pointed-Type l1)
  where

  is-prop-is-pointedly-small-Pointed-Type :
    is-prop (is-pointedly-small-Pointed-Type l2 X)
  is-prop-is-pointedly-small-Pointed-Type =
    is-prop-is-inhabited
      ( Œª (Y , e) ‚Üí
        is-prop-equiv
          ( equiv-tot ( Œª Z ‚Üí {!!}))
          {!!})
```
