## Idea

Consider a [subgroup](group-theory.subgroups.md) `H` of a
[group](group-theory.groups.md) `G`. The **normal closure** `jH` of `G` is the
least [normal subgroup](group-theory.normal-subgroups.md) of `G` that contains
`H`. The normal closure of `H` is the
[subgroup generated by](group-theory.subgroups-generated-by-subsets-groups.md)
all the [conjugates](group-theory.conjugation.md) of elements of `H`.

In other words, the normal closure operation is the lower adjoint in a
[Galois connection](order-theory.galois-connections-large-posets.md) between the
[large poset](order-theory.large-posets.md) of normal subgroups of `G` and
subgroups of `G`. The upper adjoint of this Galois connection is the inclusion
function from normal subgroups to subgroups of `G`.

Note: The normal closure should not be confused with the
[normalizer](group-theory.normalizer-subgroups.md) of a subgroup, or with the
[normal core](group-theory.normal-cores-subgroups.md) of a subgroup.
